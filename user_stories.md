# Marketing:
1. Which of our top products is most favorable amongst our target market(focus group)?
2. Of our products, which order do they rank in order of products most frequently selected when shown?
3. What was the percentage of times that an item was chosen(clicked) when it was shown?
4. What was the focus groups level of satisfaction with the products available?

# Research Team:
1. As part of the research team, what is the amount of times each image was viewed?
2. Will the products be presented in a pattern or randomly?
3. How many times does the focus group get to choose between the images shown?
4. How can we clearly show the results without running into biases or group think?

# Developer:
1. As the developer, I want to display the rules and process of the analysis to the focus group clearly.
2. I want to limit the amount of click opportunities to 25 and make sure that the images shown do not repeat in the same line-up.
3. I want the UI to be easy to interact with and I want the results to be shown clearly after the analysis has been completed.
4. I want to provide the focus group with an opportunity to rate on a scale their level of satisfaction with the products available.(stretch)

# Focus Group:
1. Are the instructions clear?
2. How many times am I able to choose?
3. Can I select more than one product during a turn?
4. What were my top selections?
5. How do my selections compare to others?

# Technical Plan Approach:
